      "martial arts master steven seagal ( not to mention director ! ) has built a career out of playing an allegedly fictitious martial arts superman who never gets hurt in fights , talks in a hushed tone , and squints at any sign of danger . \n",
      "hes also the most consistent individual in hollywood today , since all his movies suck . \n",
      "they basically represent his egotisitical tendencies about his art ( that is , martial art ) . \n",
      "im sure the guys good , and he seems like a nice guy on talk shows , although a tad haughty , but these movies he makes are all the same : a guy who is basically indestructable , is maybe wounded supposedly mortally , then comes back with a vengeance and goes buddha on all the baddies asses ( although i kinda liked \" under siege \" ) . \n",
      "of course , this one , as a change , has a \" message \" that is drilled into our mind . . . of \n",
      "course , after he blows up a lot of stuff and kills a bunch of people . \n",
      "so why do i watch his crap ? \n",
      "i usually dont . \n",
      "i will never , and you can hold me to this , i will never pay to see this mans movies , unless , and only unless , hes in a supporting role ( i . e . \n",
      " \" executive decision \" ) and id definitely pay if he dies ( i . e . \n",
      " \" executive decision \" ) . \n",
      "but this one has a special place in my heart . \n",
      "this doesnt mean its good or that i even liked it . \n",
      "this was the last movie i watched with my deceased uncle , and we had one hell of a time ripping it apart a la \" mystery science theatre 3000 , \" and this was a couple years before i had heard of \" mystery science theatre 3000 . \" \n",
      "in this one , seagal plays a worker for a mining factory set in alaska and run by the greased-up typical shallow villain , this time played by an oscar-winner to give the movie some more clout - michael caine . \n",
      "it seems that caine wants to do something with his oil factory that includes him dumping oil all over inuit land . \n",
      "around the 20-30 minute point , seagal speaks up to him in what seems to be the typical speech to all the vain entrepeneurs ( what with his new \" fire down below , \" another \" message film \" ) , and caine has him bumped off . . . or \n",
      "does he ? \n",
      "seagal is rescued by some inuits , and falls in love with one of them , played by joan chen , who can act , hypothetically , but , for some reason , not here . \n",
      "one of caines cliched henchmen ( played here with a lot of overacting by john c . mcginley ) shoots the cheif of the inuit clan , and chen and seagal go on a voyage to take down the oil factory . . . literally , \n",
      "of course . \n",
      "at one point , seagal gives a wonderfully hysterical speech about how he doesnt have any options but blow stuff up . \n",
      "he even goes as far as to say , \" i dont want to kill someone , \" and in the same breath , he asks some guy where the arsenal is . \n",
      "i have no problem with violence . \n",
      "im a huge john woo fan , but he paints his films with suspense , skill , style , depth , characterization , and just plain cool violence . \n",
      "in the films of seagal , the suspense mainly consists of the baddie attacking him stupidly , and him either wounding or killing them . \n",
      "at some points , they use the cliche of the talking villain , where the villain has the advantage , can shoot seagal , but begins talking by either telling him his big secret plan , or saying a corny line , to which seagal says something hokey back , and has had enough time to devise of a way to do away with them , and does . \n",
      "this would be okay if there were any suspense or if it didnt take itself seriously at all , like in the case of this summers \" con air . \" \n",
      "but seagal is serious about his skill , and of course , his message . \n",
      "i wouldnt mind if this was a message film in the way that they present it to you with evidence . \n",
      "but seagal has no idea how to present a film where the message is subtle , not pounded into the viewers mind . \n",
      "the villain is totally shallow and cartoonish , thus we cant take him and his motives seriously , and while seagal talks about being kind to the environment , he also goes ahead and blows up a square mile of rig , and kills some workers who were just doing his job . \n",
      "then at the end , he spends a good 10 minutes giving a speech , just in case you didnt get the message from the trailers . \n",
      "what seagal doesnt realize is that no one takes his films seriously ( although maybe a couple do ) and any message he has is no only redundant , but doesnt comfortably fit in his film , which is filled to the brim with hokey violence , crap suspense , stupid melodrama , and characters who have about as much emotional depth as a petri dish . \n",
      "as far as seagal and his acting , hes rather boring . \n",
      "he squints , he kills . \n",
      "period . \n",
      "nothing else . \n",
      "oh , yeah , theres corny one-liners ( \" im gonna reach out and touch someone ! \" ) . \n",
      "of course , hes the star , and were supposed to root for him and all , so he makes all the villains unbelievably stupid and a bunch of jerks . \n",
      "michael caine , whos a great actor , is just supposed to yell and look cold . \n",
      "he does it well , i guess , but this is no \" alfie . \" \n",
      "of coure , no one was expecting that caliber of performance from him . \n",
      "his big henchman , john c . mcginley is kinda boring as well , but is not horrible . \n",
      "and we even get a small performance from that god of drill sergeants on celluloid , r . lee ermey ( from \" full metal jacket \" ) as a hired assasin squad leader who gets to say the obligatory speech about how dangerous seagal is , just for the movie trailers and for seagals ego . \n",
      "and also , look for billy bob thornton as one of ermeys assasins . \n",
      "anyway , to conclude this all , to judge one of seagals movies is to judge all of them ( except for \" under siege \" and \" executive decision , \" though the latter is not really a \" seagal movie \" ) . \n",
      "they all have this same formula , they all have the same action , same villain , same plot , but this one has that message , which makes it more excrucitating to watch . \n",
      "i mean , if you do rent it , and i dont reccomend you do , make sure you just skip the last 10 minutes . \n",
      "but i have to put it to seagal for creating a film so bad , that the last film i viewed with my uncle was a pleasurable one . \n",
      "my ( extra star for the fun it is to watch and mock ) \n",
